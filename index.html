       <h3>FindCare is a Startup and an online platform that helps employers hire vetted and documented household, caregiving and office support workers across Nigeria at  the click of a button!! Via FindCare platform, you seamlessly access and hire screened and pre-documented care, domestic, and office support workers from the comfort of your home/office, conveniently at the click of buttons! 
        The service helps families and caregivers find matches through personalized searches and detailed profiles including background checks, online interviews, references and photos. 
        <p>We are founded on the belief that you can actually reduce your daily stress, enjoy a balanced family life and focus on priorities by sharing your workload with quality care providers.</p>
        <p> The role that domestic workers play in the growth of any society cannot therefore be disputed as they make a difference to peopleâ€™s lives and when the helper fits the family, it also provides them with a higher income to send home to support their own children. As a result, both the employer and the worker benefit mutually.</p> </h3>
